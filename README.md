# 🚘 Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System (Perception) Using Object Detection
This repository contains the implementation of the project titled _"Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System (Perception) Using Object Detection_, at the Department of Mechatronics Engineering (DOME), Federal University of Technology Minna (FUTMinna), Nigeria.

## 🧭 Overview
In autonomous driving, perception plays an important role in enabling vehicles to understand and interact safely with their surroundings. It involves sensing the environment and constructing an accurate representation so as to enable it properly navigate its environmet. 
For an autonomous vehicle to operate intelligently and safely, its perception system must effectively detect and recognize objects along its path. This project focused on developing an object detection algorithm capable of accurately identifying road anomalies and lane features along the vehicle’s path to enhance navigation and decision-making.

## 🔍 Research Objectives
- To develop an algorithm capable of detecting road anomalies specifically speed bumps, potholes and cracks along the autonomous vehicle's path.
- To accurately identify road boundaries (with and without lanes).
